This program will simulate a game of mis√®re Nim -- a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same pile. The goal of the game is to force your opponent to remove the last object.
